# Javascript-weather-app

This is a weather app made from html, css, and javascript. 

If you want to use it, you will need to make an account with https://openweathermap.org.

Next, go to https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys.

You should have an api key already generated. If not make one. 

Then copy all my code and paste the api key in line two between the two speech marks.

if you want to go into more detail with the api go to https://openweathermap.org/api
